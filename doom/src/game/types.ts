// The Doom state contract (load-bearing). `window.__doom` mirrors `DoomState`,
// and doom/e2e/doom.spec.ts asserts on it — that's how we verify the game
// *plays*, not just compiles (the same "CI for gameplay" gate Pac-Man and
// Galaga use, see ../../README.md + docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
//
// Doom is the studio's FIRST true-3D project: a first-person shooter built on
// three.js + WebGL rather than the 2D canvas the other two products use. The
// camera IS the player — its position + orientation are the player's body and
// gaze. Everything else (enemies, projectiles, pickups, doors) is published
// here in WORLD coordinates so the e2e harness can assert gameplay state
// without ever touching a pixel (WebGL pixels are unreadable in headless CI —
// see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "WebGL in headless CI").
//
// This file is intentionally the WHOLE contract for the full-FPS scope (combat,
// health/armor, multiple enemy archetypes, projectiles, pickups, doors,
// weapons) even though the scaffold only fills in the boot/loop fields plus a
// seeded enemy roster. Backlog slices flesh out the behavior behind these
// fields; they must NEVER remove a field a test depends on — add fields as
// mechanics land, deprecate by leaving them stable.

// Arena footprint comes from the level map (level.ts) so state.field + the
// floor mesh stay in sync. The #75 level-map slice introduced these and renamed
// the old FIELD_WIDTH/FIELD_HEIGHT, but left initialState() referencing the old
// names — a tsc break on main (2026-06-19). level.ts does not import types, so
// this is not circular.

 *
 *  Mirrors Galaga's GalagaInternals doc style — intentionally tiny, one method
 *  per outcome:
 *   - `forceHit` damages/kills the FIRST enemy (or `enemyId` if given) as if a
 *     player shot just landed; lethal damage flips that enemy to 'dead' and
 *     awards its score.
 *   - `forceDamage` reduces player health by `amount` (default a small chip);
 *     on LETHAL damage the player dies (alive=false) and `status` flips to a
 *     terminal state ('lost' → 'gameover').
 *   - `forcePickup` marks a pickup taken (the first un-taken one, or `id` if
 *     given) and APPLIES its effect (health/armor/ammo).
 *   - `advance` runs the fixed-step simulation `steps` times SYNCHRONOUSLY with
 *     a forced movement override, bypassing rAF + the wall clock entirely.
 *     This makes movement FRAME-RATE-INDEPENDENT for the harness — essential
 *     because Doom renders with WebGL, and under headless SwiftShader the rAF
 *     that drives the engine's fixed-step accumulator (engine.ts start()) fires
 *     far slower than 60Hz. A test that holds a key for a fixed wall-clock
 *     `waitForTimeout` therefore moves a NON-DETERMINISTIC, machine-dependent
 *     distance: green locally, far short in CI. `advance` instead steps the
 *     sim a known number of times, so travel = steps × PLAYER_SPEED_PER_TICK is
 *     exact regardless of render cadence. It mirrors Galaga's
 *     deterministic-internals philosophy. The forced input feeds the SAME input
 *     path real `update()` reads (the per-tick snapshot), so movement +
 *     wall-collision clamping run identically to live play. Test-only: gameplay
 *     code must NEVER call it.
 *   - `fire` triggers ONE hitscan shot SYNCHRONOUSLY from the current camera
 *     pose, going through the same path Space does (consume ammo, raycast,
 *     damage + score on hit, append to `hits`). Test-only; bypasses the input
